Subject: [PATCH 5/8] Documentation: leds: standardise keyboard backlight led
 names

Advice use of either "input*:*:kbd_backlight" or ":*:kbd_backlight". We
don't want people using vendor or product name (e.g. "smc", "apple",
"asus") as this information is available from sysfs anyway, and it made the
folder names inconsistent.
